title: Thanksgiving and memorial service for Mandy Klyne
---

A thanksgiving and memorial service for Mandy Klyne will be held in Oxford at [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk) on 12 August 2016.

The service will start at 16:00 in the [Leonard Wolfson auditorium](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/gallery/meeting-spaces), and will be followed by a light buffet, with opportunity for guests to exchange personal memories in the delightful college grounds.

Dress comfortably: this is not intended to be a formal occasion.

If you are planning to attend, it would be most helpful if you would send an email to [<mandy.klyne.memorial@gmail.com>](mailto:mandy.klyne.memorial@gmail.com) to help us assess numbers for catering.

Further details will be posted here as they come available - please check back for any last-minute information.

I've been relying on the grapevine to pass the word among Mandy's friends and ex-colleagues: if you know anyone who knew Mandy and who has not already heard, please forward the link that appears at the bottom of this page.

It appears that some emails to me at ninebynine.org have gone missing.  If you've contacted me about the service, and received no response, please try resending to [<mandy.klyne.memorial@gmail.com>](mailto:mandy.klyne.memorial@gmail.com).
