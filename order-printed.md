# Thanks

I (Graham) would like to thank everyone who sent cards and messages of sympathy, and all of you who attend this service in thanksgiving for and memory of Mandy.  I would especially like to thank:

- Becky Fisher, who I initially asked as an old friend of Mandy's to say a few words on behalf of our village, but ended up being "persuaded" to lead the entire memorial service.

- Reverend Helen Kendrick, minister for Appleford and Sutton Courtenay, who in one extraordinary meeting provided comfort and helped to channel our response to Mandy's death.  She all but solved a number of problems I would face when dealing with the practicalities, before I even knew I had them.

- Louise and the events team at [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk), who have been most helpful in facilitating our use of the college facilities and surrounding grounds for this congregation in memory of Mandy.

- [Jennifer Hill](http://www.harpteacher.co.uk), our harpist today, who agreed to play at rather short notice.  She was Mandy's choice to provide music at Rhiannon's wedding, enhancing the overall atmosphere in a subtle but transformative way.

- Rhiannon's husband Steve, who has provided comfort and clear-headed support to all of Mandy's close family.

# To be followed by

A buffet reception in the Haldane Room.

There will be a book of remembrance in which guests are enjoined to write their favourite memories and thoughts about Mandy.  Also, there will be an opportunity for you to remember Mandy in personal reflection, casting petals from Wolfon's Rainbow Bridge onto the Cherwell.

Donations in memory of Mandy, if offered, will be presented to [Cancer Research](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org).


# Desiderata

_(This poem has a long association with Mandy, going back to her school days.  She had it on her wall or bookshelves through much her time as a student.)_

Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.  
Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.  
Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.  
Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.  
Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  
Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.  
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.  
Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.  
And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be.  
And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.

_(Max Ehrmann)_
