See [directions on the Wolfson College web site](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/gallery/visit-us)

Wolfson College is about 2 miles from Oxford station.  If you have 45 minutes to spare, the walk through University Parks and North Oxford can be pleasant.  The Google directions can be found [here](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/Oxford,+United+Kingdom/University+of+Oxford,+Wolfson+College,+Linton+Road,+Oxford+OX2+6UD,+United+Kingdom/@51.76194,-1.2804309,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x4876c6a2790faf05:0xba97a9d53201a3c!2m2!1d-1.2699993!2d51.7535423!1m5!1m1!1s0x4876c4059005a4d1:0x4e39181df53da749!2m2!1d-1.2547031!2d51.7708907!3e2).  Alternatively, it is a taxi ride of about 5-10 minutes.

There is car paring available at Wolfson College, but if this fills up there is some on-street parking nearby that becomes available for use at 4PM.  The traffic leaving Oxford will probably be very heavy about this time, but coming in to Oxford will hopefully be bearable.  Be aware that there are road works on the Northern section of the Oxford ring road on the A40 between Wolvercote and Cutteslowe roundabouts.  Expect traffic in this area to be very slow.
