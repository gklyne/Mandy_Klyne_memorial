<p>Say not in grief that she is no more, but in thankfulness that she was.</p>

<p><em>(Jewish advice in death)</em></p>

<h2 id="words-of-welcome">WORDS OF WELCOME</h2>

<p>We have come together because we loved Mandy<br />
As wife, mother, sister, colleague, friend.</p>

<p>Here we will mourn her leaving us,<br />
honour her life and death,<br />
and comfort each other.</p>

<p>We have come believing that all human life is valuable,<br />
that the truth and integrity and hopefulness<br />
which resides in each life, lives on.</p>

<p>We come, believing that Mandy’s life,<br />
which we celebrate today <br />
and for which we now experience great loss,<br />
is joined in the eternal continuum of human endeavour<br />
stretching into the past and into the future.</p>

<p>Mandy’s life was lived in its uniqueness with us<br />
and has now passed into the ultimate community of human existence.</p>

<p>The gifts and graces which she offered are never lost to us.</p>

<p>The creativity which he/she brought to us in her life and relationships<br />
lies now within our own lives and travels into the future with us.</p>

<p>Our lives are more beautiful because we lived with her.</p>

<p><em>(Marie lights first candle @@says?)</em></p>

<p>The first candle represents our grief.<br />
The pain of losing you Mandy is still intense.<br />
It reminds us of the depth of our love for you.</p>

<p><em>(William lights second candle @@says?)</em></p>

<p>The second candle represents our courage.<br />
To confront our sorrow,<br />
To comfort each other,<br />
To change our lives.</p>

<p><em>(Rhiannon lights third candle)</em></p>

<p>The third candle we light in your memory, Mandy,<br />
For the times we laughed,<br />
The times we cried,<br />
The times we were angry with each other,<br />
The silly things you did,<br />
The caring and joy you gave us.</p>

<p><em>(Ronan lights fourth candle)</em></p>

<p>The fourth candle we light for our love.<br />
We light this candle that your light will always shine<br />
as we share this time of grief and sorrow with family and friends.<br />
We cherish the special place in our hearts that will always be reserved for you.<br />
We thank you for the gift your living brought to each of us.</p>

<p>You can close your eyes<br />
And pray that she’ll come back,<br />
Or you can open your eyes,<br />
And see all she’s left.</p>

<p>Your heart can be empty,<br />
Because you can’t see here,<br />
Or you can be full of the love you shared.</p>

<p>You can turn your back on tomorrow<br />
and live yesterday,<br />
Or you can be happy for tomorrow<br />
because of yesterday.</p>

<p>You can remember her and only that she’s gone,<br />
Or you can cherish her memory and let it live on.</p>

<p>You can cry and close your mind,<br />
Be empty and turn your back,<br />
Or you can do what she’d want:<br />
Smile, open your eyes, love and go on.</p>

<h2 id="bible-reading---1-corinthians-131-13">BIBLE READING - 1 Corinthians 13.1-13</h2>

<p><em>(Becky)</em></p>

<p>If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.</p>

<p>Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</p>

<p>Love never ends.</p>

<p><em>(Becky)</em></p>

<p>@@ are these words of commital appropriate here? @@</p>

<p>Since Mandy’s life has now come to an end,<br />
we commit her body to the elements/ground,<br />
which is welcoming to us at the time of our death.<br />
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.<br />
In the cycle of life and death the earth is replenished<br />
and life is eternally renewed.</p>

<p>To love someone is to risk the pain of parting.<br />
Not to love is never to have lived.<br />
The grief which we now experience is the honouring of our love.<br />
Let us now in a quiet moment make our farewell to Mandy.</p>

<h2 id="reading---desiderata">READING - Desiderata</h2>

<p><em>(This poem has a long association with Mandy back to her school days.  I recall she had it on her wall or bookshelves through much her time as a student.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Ian, my cousin)</em></p>

<p>Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.<br />
Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.<br />
Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.<br />
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.<br />
Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.<br />
Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.<br />
Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.<br />
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.<br />
Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.<br />
And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be.<br />
And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.”</p>

<p><em>(Max Ehrmann)</em></p>

<h2 id="closing">CLOSING???</h2>

<p>As we bid farewell to Mandy, let us commit ourselves to loving and supporting those who miss her most, especially all the members of Mandy’s family and close friends.</p>

<p>And now let us go into the world,<br />
Glad that we have loved,<br />
Free to weep for the one we have lost,<br />
Free to hold each other in our human frailty,<br />
Determined to live life to the full<br />
As did Mandy.</p>

<h2 id="the-blessing">The Blessing</h2>

<p>And may the love and peace of God,<br />
Be with you and those whom you love<br />
and with those who love you,<br />
today and always. Amen.</p>
