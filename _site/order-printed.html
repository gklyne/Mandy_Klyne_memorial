<h1 id="thanks">Thanks</h1>

<p>I (Graham) would like to thank everyone who sent cards and messages of sympathy, and all of you who attend this service in thanksgiving for and memory of Mandy.  I would especially like to thank:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Becky Fisher, who I initially asked as an old friend of Mandy’s to say a few words on behalf of our village, but ended up being “persuaded” to lead the entire memorial service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reverend Helen Kendrick, minister for Appleford and Sutton Courtenay, who in one extraordinary meeting provided comfort and helped to channel our response to Mandy’s death.  She all but solved a number of problems I would face when dealing with the practicalities, before I even knew I had them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Louise and the events team at <a href="https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk">Wolfson College</a>, who have been most helpful in facilitating our use of the college facilities and surrounding grounds for this congregation in memory of Mandy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.harpteacher.co.uk">Jennifer Hill</a>, our harpist today, who agreed to play at rather short notice.  She was Mandy’s choice to provide music at Rhiannon’s wedding, enhancing the overall atmosphere in a subtle but transformative way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rhiannon’s husband Steve, who has provided comfort and clear-headed support to all of Mandy’s close family.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A buffet reception in the Haldane Room.</p>

<p>Donations in memory of Mandy, if offered, will be presented to <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org">Cancer Research</a>.</p>

<p><em>(This poem has a long association with Mandy, going back to her school days.  She had it on her wall or bookshelves through much her time as a student.)</em></p>

<p>Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.<br />
Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.<br />
Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.<br />
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.<br />
Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.<br />
Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.<br />
Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.<br />
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.<br />
Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.<br />
And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be.<br />
And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.</p>

<p><em>(Max Ehrmann)</em></p>
